# Quaternary Calculator 7

This project is a collaboration between
Noah Oosterhoff, Connor Vessely, Jared Bowman,
Gio Velasco, and Peter Owolabi to create a
quaternary calculator to allow users to be
able to perform various quaternary calculations.

## How to Use The Calculator
This calculator performs calculations using the 
quaternary numerical system, with the option to 
display results in decimal.

Use the number buttons only to input the number.
The square root (R) and square buttons can be 
chosen and will immediately display the result.
OR
The addition, subtraction, division, or 
multiplication button can be selected.
Then, the user must input a second number using
the number buttons on the calculator and select the
equals button to display the result of the operation.

The clear (C) button can be used to clear any number 
or operator inputs that were selected.
The toggle button can be used to instead display the 
result in decimal. Numbers cannot be input in decimal.
